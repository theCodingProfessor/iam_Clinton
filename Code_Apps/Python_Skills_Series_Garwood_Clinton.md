### Repository Overview

The **Python Lab Assignment Library** offers two distinct versions of the assignments:
- **Original Version**: Designed for Python 3.9+, used in past CIS 135 courses.
- **Updated Version**: Supports the latest Python 3.12 syntax, incorporating updated practices and modernized language features.

**Note**: The repository includes only the sample code for each assignment. Assignment instructions are not posted to ensure integrity for use in academic settings. Assignment requirements may vary, so copying this code verbatim may not satisfy your lab requirements. 

### Usage Guidelines

Feel free to explore the code in this library for educational purposes:
- Use it as a reference for foundational programming concepts and Python syntax.
- Adapt portions of the code in your own projects as needed, noting the source repository URL in your comments if you do so.
- Experiment by modifying the code to improve your understanding of each topic.

### Topics Covered

The assignments cover essential programming concepts, such as:
- Variables and data types
- Control structures (loops and conditionals)
- Functions and modular programming
- Basic data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets)
- File I/O
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) fundamentals
