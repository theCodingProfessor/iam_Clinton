## Visiting Data Scientist with the USGS

This summary highlights the academic research collaboration established between the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Joliet Junior College (JJC) to study Asian Carp behavior in North America.

### University Faculty Liaison and Research Partner

In 2018, I joined the USGS as a visiting scientist, working alongside Dr. Patrick Mills, then Chair of the Natural Sciences Department at Joliet Junior College. Together, we built a collaborative research partnership between JJC ([jjc.edu](https://www.jjc.edu)) and the United States Geological Survey ([usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov)), focusing on the impact of Asian Carp in the Mississippi River watershed and Great Lakes region.

This multi-year partnership marked the first of its kind between a community college and the USGS, resulting in original research, multiple poster presentations, and ongoing opportunities for JJC students to engage directly with the U.S. Department of the Interior.

### My Project Roles 

#### Partnership Building
- Maintain direct communication with our USGS Research Liaison.
- Engage in annual program planning and participate in project-level research development sessions.

#### Programming and Data Science
- Support teams and individuals in programming languages such as R, C++, Java, and Python (SciPy, Numpy, Pandas), including assistance with web interface development and the use of IoT/micro-sensory data collection devices.
- Introduce undergraduate students to scientific research methods through data science applications.
- Conduct analyses on diverse datasets, including text files, CSVs, spreadsheets, video footage, and sensory data, utilizing statistical and computational methods.

#### Promotion and Publicity
- Participate in press conferences, media interviews, and summits to discuss research achievements and partnership milestones.

#### Quality Assurance
- Supervise students working with USGS-managed data from various laboratory and field studies.
- Prepare field research associates (students) with equipment training, testing protocols, and safety measures for fieldwork.

### Project Highlights

#### Machine Learning Training 
**Spring 2021**  
- **Location**: Columbia Environmental Research Center (CERC), USGS, Columbia, MO  
- Attended a professional training on Noldus machine learning video analysis software, with a focus on feature identification, data processing, and study analysis.

#### Original Laboratory Research Projects
**Summer 2020**  
- **Profile**: Supervised two three-week external research internships.  
- **Location**: Columbia Environmental Research Center (CERC), Columbia, MO  
- **Partner**: United States Geological Survey, U.S. Department of the Interior  
  - **Focus 1**: Analyzed Grass Carp feeding behavior using a forty-bay aquarium setup.
  - **Focus 2**: Conducted a retention study with ARIES sonar in a pond setting, examining fish responses to amino acid-enriched feed.

#### Full-Scale Field Studies 
- **Spring 2019**  
  - **Profile**: Six-week, six-student field study on Asian Carp behavior using hoop nets.  
  - **Location**: Illinois River near Ottawa, IL  
  - **Partners**: Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IL-DNR) and USGS  
  - **Focus**: Evaluated the effectiveness of flavored bait in attracting Asian Carp to netting sites.

- **Fall 2019**  
  - **Profile**: Four-week, four-student field study on pre-hibernation behaviors of Asian Carp.  
  - **Location**: Illinois River near Ottawa, IL  
  - **Partners**: Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IL-DNR) and USGS  
  - **Focus**: Measured pre-hibernation catch rates using amino acid-infused bait to optimize capture efforts.

#### Foundational Partnership Development
**Summer 2018**  
- **Location**: Weitendorf Agricultural Facility, Joliet Junior College  
- **Profile**: Assisted in the establishment of the JJCâ€“USGS partnership, supported the development of a new aquatics lab, and collaborated with student groups on data analysis projects.
